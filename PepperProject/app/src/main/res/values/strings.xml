    <string name="explaining_addition">Explaining addition...</string>
    <string name="addition_explanation">Addition is when we combine numbers together. For example, if you have 2 apples and I give you 3 more, you now have 2 plus 3, which equals 5 apples. The plus sign means we are adding numbers together.</string>

    <!-- New Math Explanations -->
    <string name="explaining_subtraction">Explaining subtraction...</string>
    <string name="subtraction_explanation">Subtraction is when we take away numbers. For example, if you have 5 candies and you eat 2 of them, you now have 5 minus 2, which equals 3 candies left. The minus sign means we are taking away or subtracting numbers.</string>
    
    <string name="explaining_multiplication">Explaining multiplication...</string>
    <string name="multiplication_explanation">Multiplication is a faster way of adding the same number multiple times. For example, 3 times 4 means adding 3 four times: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12. If you have 3 bags with 4 marbles in each, you have 3 times 4, which equals 12 marbles in total.</string>
    
    <string name="explaining_division">Explaining division...</string>
    <string name="division_explanation">Division is sharing numbers into equal groups. For example, if you have 8 cookies and want to share them equally between 2 friends, each friend gets 8 divided by 2, which equals 4 cookies each. The division sign means we are splitting numbers into equal parts.</string>
